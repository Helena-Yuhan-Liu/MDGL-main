    Tensorflow code for Recurrent Spiking Neural Network (so called Long short term memory Spiking Neural Network, LSNN).
    
    For more details:
    Long short-term memory and learning-to-learn in networks of spiking neurons
    Guillaume Bellec*, Darjan Salaj*, Anand Subramoney*, Robert Legenstein, Wolfgang Maass
    * equal contributions
    
    Authors contributions:
    GB implemented the initial code of the spiking RNN in Tensorflow. DS lead most of the sequential-MNIST simulation.
    AS added features to the model and helped making the code distributable. AR helped to optimize the code.
